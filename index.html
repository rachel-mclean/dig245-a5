    <h2>Test Summary:</h2>
    <div class="row">

        <p>
          <a href=https://www.petfinder.com/ > PetFinder</a> is a website that matches potential pet owners with adoptable animals. To conduct this usability test, I created 5 tasks for my dad to complete on the Petfinder
          website. My dad is a realistic user for this website because my family has adopted all of our pets in the past, so this site is a possibility for us to use in the future. The 5 tasks and their results are
          described below.

    <h2>1. Search for a dog and filter the results by breed & size. </h2>
    <p>  My dad's first instinct (and mine) was to use the search bar to place a specific search for a dog. That didn't work â€” because weirdly enough, the search bar <em>only</em> searches
      through articles on the website, not their database of animals. Once clicked, the search bar says "search articles" on the left, but my dad was concentrating on typing his search, so
      he didn't see these words at all. My dad's search led to an article, shown on the far right below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The image on the far shows the search bar after it is clicked. My dad didn't like that it expands to obscure the other tabs on the homepage (pictured above), so that it is less obvious to a new user
      how to correctly search for an animal. Eventually, my dad clicked on "Find a dog" lower down the page to successfully complete the task. He found the filters on the sidebar easily.

    <h2>2. Remove the "breed" filter. </h2>
    <p>
      I expected my dad to hit the 'x's at the end of each purple filter label, but instead
      he opened the sidebar dropdowns to individually remove his selected filter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He completed this task pretty quickly, and mentioned that the '+' and '-' signs at the end of the filter selection were slightly confusing.
      He was also annoyed that he couldn't deselect a breed that he <em>didn't </em>want in his results; he could only select the breeds that he <em>did </em> want.
      The left image shows the results before removing the breed filter, and the right shows the results once the breed filter has been removed.

    <h2>3. 'Favorite' several dogs, then access your Favorites List</h2>
    <p>
      My dad found the heart button in the corner of each dog's profile immediately, but it took him around 30 seconds to find the collective list of his favorited dogs, which is found by clicking the heart
      button at the top of the webpage. He noticed that this heart button is purple on the My Favorites page, but turns gray
      on any other page. He thought that keeping the button purple would make it easier to find.

    <h2>4. 'Save' the current search.</h2>
    <p>
      My dad found the 'Save Search' button very quickly. Once he closed out of the verification window,
      he clicked on 'Saved Searches' to verify for imself that the save had been successful.

    <h2>5. Search for a ferret.</h2>
    <p>
      My dad noticed that there was no filter on the sidebar to change species from dog to ferret. After
      a couple seconds of searching, he found the dog icon under the Petfinder logo, which led to a dropdown
      to select a different species of animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed that the filter 'medium-sized' carried over from his dog search, even though he selected 'Small & Furry'.
      Once he deselected that filter, he selected 'Ferret' under the 'Species' filter and successfully completed the final task.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      My dad successfully completed all tasks. He navigated the site fairly easily, but had difficuly in some parts. After talking with
      him and observing his experience on the site, here are several suggestions he came up with.
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>
      Change the configuration and focus of the search bar completely.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the filters section, allow for the <em>de</em>selection of certain characteristics.
    </li>
    <li>
      Get rid of the '+' and '-' signs at the end of the filter selections.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make the Favorites icon on the page header consistenly purple.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove old filters when switching species.
    </li>
    </ol>
